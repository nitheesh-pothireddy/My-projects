### README

This repository contains a Python script for performing Fourier Series Regression on a dataset and making predictions using the trained model. The dataset used for this demonstration is included as `scr-dataset.csv`.

Overview:

- `Crescer - Fourier Series Regression.ipynb`: Python notebook that reads the dataset, performs Fourier Series Regression, trains a linear regression model, evaluates model performance, and makes predictions for a new data point.

Dependencies:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scipy

Instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the notebook `Crescer - Fourier Series Regression.ipynb`.

3. Run through each cell in `Crescer - Fourier Series Regression.ipynb`

4. View the output in the terminal, including the predicted value for `x=50`.

5. Ensure that all dependencies are installed before running the notebook.

6. The notebook is well-commented for clarity and understanding. 

Dataset:

The dataset (`scr-dataset.csv`) contains two columns: `x` and `y`, representing the independent and dependent variables, respectively.
It can be found in the Crescer dataset branch of the repository.

Output:

- The script generates visualizations of the dataset and its Fourier transformed amplitudes.
- It trains a linear regression model and evaluates its performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Finally, it predicts the value of `y` for `x=50`.
