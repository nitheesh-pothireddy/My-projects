Data Science Multilabel Classification

Description:
This repository contains Python code for performing multilabel classification using machine learning algorithms. The code is designed to handle datasets with multiple labels for each instance. Three classifiers are implemented: Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Simple Neural Network. The classifiers are trained on a given dataset and used to predict labels for a test dataset. The repository also includes preprocessing steps for handling categorical data and evaluating classifier performance metrics such as accuracy and hamming loss.

Folder Structure:
- datasets: Contains the input data files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `trainLabels.csv`).
- code: Contains the Python scripts for preprocessing data and implementing multilabel classification (`multilabel_classification.py`).
- output: Contains the output predictions generated by the classifiers (`NitheeshP-prediction-output.csv`).
- README.md: Provides an overview of the repository and instructions for running the code.

Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `code` directory.
3. Run the `multilabel_classification.py` script to execute the code.
4. Ensure that the required Python libraries are installed (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn).
5. Review the output predictions generated in the `output` directory.
6. Modify the code as needed for your specific use case.

Additional Notes:
- The code is written in Python 3 and utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas.
- Feel free to contribute to the repository by adding new features, improving existing code, or fixing any bugs.
- For any questions or issues, please create a new GitHub issue in the repository.
