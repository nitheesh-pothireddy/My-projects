Data Science Multilabel Classification

Description:
This repository contains Python code for performing multilabel classification using machine learning algorithms. The code is designed to handle datasets with multiple labels for each instance. Three classifiers are implemented: Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Simple Neural Network. The classifiers are trained on a given dataset and used to predict labels for a test dataset. The repository also includes preprocessing steps for handling categorical data and evaluating classifier performance metrics such as accuracy and hamming loss.

Folder Structure:
- datasets: Contains the input data files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `trainLabels.csv`). They are present in the 'GIBots - Multilabel Classification files' branch of my repository for reference.
- code: Contains the Python scripts for preprocessing data and implementing multilabel classification (`multilabel_classification.py`).
- output: Will be shown below as images of the output.
- README.md: Provides an overview of the repository and instructions for running the code.

Instructions:
1. Open the notebook 'GIBots - Multilabel Classification.ipnyb'
2. Ensure that the required Python libraries are installed (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn).
3. Run through each of the cells.
4. Review the output predictions generated in the output images below.
